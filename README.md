This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

The e-School Management application is a comprehensive tool designed to streamline administrative tasks and facilitate efficient management of educational institutions. Developed using Next.js with MongoDB as the database backend, this application is tailored to meet the specific needs of school administrators, providing robust features for managing teachers, students, courses, groups, and subjects.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the e-School Management application repository to your local machine.
2. Install project dependencies using the command npm install.
3. Configure environment variables, including MongoDB credentials and any necessary API keys.
4. Start the development server by running npm run dev.

```bash
npm install
# then
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
